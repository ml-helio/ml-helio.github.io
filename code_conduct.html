<h6>

<ul>
&nbsp;<li>We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.</li>
&nbsp;<li>We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.</li>
&nbsp;<li>We pledge to be courteous with the opinions of others and be mindful not to exclude anyone from discussions or work-related activities. We realize that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular, discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies, programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely express their opinions.</li>
&nbsp;<li>We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying particular attention to those new to the community. We pledge to provide respectful criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in discussion threads resulting from code contributions.</li>
&nbsp;<li>We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement, both within our community and where we are criticized. We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as people within our community.</li>
&nbsp;<li>We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the meeting at the sole discretion of the organizers. Any participant who wishes to report a violation of this policy should speak, in confidence, to SOC members Veronique Delouille (v.delouille@oma.be), Monica Bobra (mbobra@sun.stanford.edu), or Enrico Camporeale (e.camporeale@cwi.nl)</li>
&nbsp;	</br>

Machine Learning in Heliophysics code of conduct is based on the <a href="http://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html" target="_blank"><u> Astropy Community Code of Conduct</u></a>. </h6>
